JpegDate is a small program to tag your jpeg files, from your digital
camera, with the date and time when you actually took the picture.

Some Jpeg file types (yes, there is more than one) have the date and
time stored internally, and with JpegDate you can read these dates
and add it to your file name.

Bugs:

  * Doing a mask like '*.jpg' does not match 'file.example.jpg'
